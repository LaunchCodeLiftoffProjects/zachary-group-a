1. Overview

    Our app idea for Zachary K - Group A (Team Name TBD) is one that we would like to use an analogy to explain. We are looking to an existing app called OpenTable for some guidance. In case you are not familiar with OpenTable, the app is used primarily by two main user groups: restaurants and diners. Restaurants use the app to post their hours, menu, and available reservations. Diners are able to establish a profile, search for a place to eat, & book a reservation.

    For our project, we intend to apply similar concepts to answer the problem that Rec Sports Players and League/Facility Managers face every season – how to efficiently communicate between players, coaches, & facility managers.

    Our app will allow users to login and view Venues and their associated Events, then register for whatever events suit their interests. Venue Administrators will be able to create/update/delete Events, and each Venue will have a list of users that can act as Venue Administrators for that particular Venue.

2. Features

    a. Register/Login: Users will be able to register for an account and login to view the app. Aside from the home page and the login page, all pages will be restricted to logged in users.

    b. Venue Page: Users will be able to view all the upcoming events for a particular venue on the Venue Page.

    c. Create Events: Administrators for a particular venue will be able to create new events on the Venue Page.

    d. Register for Events: Users will be able to register for events on the Venue Page.

    e. Play4All will be able to connect to a MySQL database containing user profiles, venues, and events.

3. Technologies

    a. Java/SpringBoot

    b. TypeScript/Angular

    c. MySQL/MySQL Workbench

    d. Hibernate

    e. HTML/CSS
    
    f. Bootstrap

4. What we’ll have to learn

    For this project, our group will have to learn how to connect a SpringBoot back end to an angular front end.
